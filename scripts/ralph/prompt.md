# Ralph Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous coding agent working on a software project.

## Your Task

1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check it out or create from main.
4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`
5. Implement that single user story
6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your project requires)
7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)
8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story
10. Append your progress to `progress.txt

## Progress Report Format
